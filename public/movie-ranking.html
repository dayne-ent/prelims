<h1>The Best Movies According to Daniel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>The Boys</h3>
<p>In my Opinion, It is the best series i have ever set my eyes on </p>

<h3>Free Guy</h3>
<p>A banger movie about AI Characters in a game being able to gain consciousness</p>

<h3>Attack On Titan (Anime)</h3>
<p>A True Masterpiece! Way better than most movies today. Has the best plot i have ever seen. No anime or movie has come close to it ever since it wrapped up.</p>
